## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### MediaPipe Installation Issues
```bash
# Try these commands if MediaPipe fails to install
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mediapipe --no-cache-dir

# Alternative: conda installation
conda install -c conda-forge mediapipe
```

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Clean setup
python run.py --setup --force

# Check dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try different Python version (3.9-3.11 recommended)
```

#### Image Analysis Not Working
- Ensure MediaPipe is installed: `pip install mediapipe`
- Check image format (JPG, PNG supported)
- Verify full body is visible in photo
- Use good lighting and plain background
